# I also make **_software_** to make **music** with **computers**.

## ...using **JavaScript**!?

**Web Audio**, **Web MIDI**, **Electron** (packaged Chromium + Node.js apps)

> I know what you're thinking...

# _Why would you do that?_

# Playing computer music **live** is ... uh... _complicated_.

> For most bands and musicians this is not a problem. If you are a guitarist, it makes no difference whether you are playing on stage or recording in a studio. In both cases, you are playing the guitar. In most cases with music, the album is just a recording of what the musicians would do anyway. The great thing about this is the musician can intuitively pick up on the feeling in the room and change the way the are playing to accommodate this. They might not even notice they're doing it. There is this amazing feeling that comes from a band jamming with each other, and vibing off the audience.

> But this is not the case with most computer music. I was creating music on a timeline.

### **Painted**, not played.

> This leaves only a few options.

## _Option 1_: Recruit some musicians and **play it for real**!

> This is actually something that would be a lot of fun, but it is not representative of my musical process. I'd be doing completely different things in the studio to what I'm doing on stage. It would be treating the album like a score, things would get very complicated very quick with the amount of sounds I use.

## _Option 2_: **DJ it!** (_just press play..._)

> The performance would be more like an exhibition, much like how a painter would present their work. But I don't find this very fun. I want to perform, share and be in the moment with the audience, able to easily adapt to the room vibe. Not just a boring and predictable exhibit.

## _Option 3_: Play **everything** yourself!
